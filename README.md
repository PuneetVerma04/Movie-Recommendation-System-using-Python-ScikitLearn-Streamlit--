# Machine Learning Model with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit

This repository hosts a machine learning model developed in Python using scikit-learn and deployed with Streamlit. The data used for developing this model is sourced from Kaggle, involving analysis, preprocessing, and model building.

## Overview

The project focuses on using python libraries to make a machine learning model for recommending movies for entered movie. It includes analysis of Kaggle data, preprocessing steps, model building using scikit-learn, and creating an interactive web application using Streamlit. This model is developed in Google Colab and the web application is made using VS Code.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is downloaded from Kaggle [provide the link to the Kaggle dataset]. Please download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory before running the code.

## Project Structure

The repository structure is as follows:

- `dataset.csv/`: Contains the Kaggle dataset used for training and analysis.
- `Main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook or Python script for data analysis and preprocessing.
- `app.py`: Streamlit web application for showcasing the model.
